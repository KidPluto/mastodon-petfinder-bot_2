I was attempting to not have to write, or look at the code, when creating this bot.  I was mostly successful at that. 

The Petfinder API will fail every once and a while.  When that happened I tried looking at the code, until I realized it was just an intermittent thing, it was a problem with the code.

At one point it offered a query for Dogs & Cats, only to afterwards admit only one type of pet could be queried at a time.
It's confusing that it knows the correct value to pass to the API, but only after being challenged.  Why not give me the correct code on the first iteration?

One thing I learned was that Github Actions will run the script on a schedule.
