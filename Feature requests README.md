# Todo list

* Ensure the listing has a photo.  If it doesn't get a different one.
* Create a new bot, which would run once a week.  If would list the shelters I'm using and a count of the number of cats available for adoption.  It would post that to the same mastodon account.
* Is mastodon /v2 endpoints available?  I keep seeing messages about /v1 being deprecated

# Completed
* Does the listing include a link to the shelter?  If so include that with the post.  Actually the post already had that.
* Reduce posting the same listing.  Keep a list of the posts from the last x number of days.  And get a different listing if there is a match. This seems to be working
