# Todo list

* Ensure the listing has a photo.  If it doesn't get a different one.
* Create a new bot, which would run once a week.  If would list the shelters I'm using and a count of the number of cats available for adoption.  It would post that to the same mastodon account.  No success with this one yet.
* Is mastodon /v2 endpoints available?  I keep seeing messages about /v1 being deprecated
* Why when I push, sometimes, github doesn't ask me to merge?  Why is that push not seen?
* The readme I just asked to be created, mentions tracking the last 7 says posts.  How is that done?

# Completed
* Does the listing include a link to the shelter?  If so include that with the post.  Actually the post already had that.
* Reduce posting the same listing.  Keep a list of the posts from the last x number of days.  And get a different listing if there is a match. This seems to be working
* * There is an icon of paw prints included in the post.  Can I change that up?  There are different icons for cat faces.
